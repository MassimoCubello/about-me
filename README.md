# about-me
Additional class files and exercises from Workshops in Web Development.

For this task in HTTP-5114, I created a basic one page website using HTML and CSS with a few details about me, and then deployed it to GitHub Pages and Infinity Free Hosting.

Basic README.md and .gitignore files were created for this repo as well.
