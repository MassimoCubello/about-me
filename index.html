        <h1>Massimo Cubello</h1>
        <p>I'm a <strong>web developer</strong> with a background in marketing and customer success. My journey into tech grew from years of helping clients market their solutions, solving operational problems, and telling stories that connect people. Now, I'm bringing those skills into development by building web experiences that are not only functional but also engaging, user-friendly, and human-centred.</p>
